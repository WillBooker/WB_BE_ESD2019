Repository for data and code used in plots for paper submitted to ESurfD, by W.H. Booker and B.C. Eaton

Files consist of the data used to create figures included in the paper, in preparation under the title "Stabilising Large Grains in Aggrading Steep Channels" for submission to Easth Surface Dynamics (Copernicus).
The data comprise the grain size distributions used in the experiments, example rasters of classified images, water surface slope values nad derivative transport efficiency values, and the code necessary to create these plots.
