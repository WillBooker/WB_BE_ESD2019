Repository for data and code used in plots for paper submitted to ESurfD, by W.H. Booker and B.C. Eaton

Files consist of the data used to create figures included in the paper "Stabilising large grains in self-forming steep channels" in press at Earth Surface Dynamics (Copernicus).
The data comprise the grain size distributions used in the experiments, example rasters of classified images, water surface slope values nad derivative transport efficiency values, grain output data, and the code necessary to create these plots.
